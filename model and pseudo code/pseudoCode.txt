this program calculates the least number of granite flagstones which can be used to pave
a square in a rectangular shape
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

declare a function getNeededNumberForSideN to calculate the number of flagstones needed to cover side n by rounding up (n/a) --> function1 
declare a function getNeededNumberForSideM to calculate the number of flagstones needed to cover side m by rounding up (m/a) --> function2
declare a function getTotal to calculate the total number of flagstones needed to pave the square by function1 * function2

in the main function : 

prompt to take input 1 which is n
prompt to take input 2 which is m
prompt to take input 3 which is a

// calling the gitTotal function 
display the number
